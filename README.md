## About the Project
RoomieU was inspired by our own struggles as students navigating the challenges of finding housing and housemates. From dealing with incompatible roommates to the frustration of securing sublets in Kingston during the summer, we realized there had to be a better way. The current options felt overwhelming, time-consuming, and disconnected from the unique needs of university students. RoomieU was born out of our desire to create a tailored solution that simplifies the process and reduces stress for students like us.

The app works by allowing users to log in securely and create personalized profiles. Each profile includes preferences for housing and lifestyle to maximize compatibility. These details, along with housing listings, are stored in a database. RoomieU allows users to swipe through other university students’ profiles nearby, offering a personalized experience tailored to their preferences.

When a match is made, the app enables direct communication through a built-in chat feature. To make starting conversations easier, we’ve implemented AI-powered conversation starter prompts. These prompts are designed to help users break the ice and get to know their potential housemates more naturally and comfortably.

RoomieU combines an intuitive design and tailored functionality to bridge the gap between technology and real-life connections, making the housing search faster, more intuitive, and stress-free for students.

## What We Learned
Throughout this project, we gained invaluable experience in full-stack development and user-centered design. We built confidence using tools such as **API calls for OpenAI**, **Git**, and **Streamlit**—many of which were new to us or areas where we previously had limited experience.

From developing the swiping functionality for efficient and seamless matching to designing visually appealing and functional UI components, we focused on creating a platform that is intuitive for a smooth user experience. This process also taught us the importance of teamwork, as we worked collaboratively to develop code synchronously. By coordinating efforts, managing version control, and ensuring consistent integration, we enhanced both the functionality of the app and our ability to collaborate effectively as a team.

## How We Built It
RoomieU was built using **Python** and **Streamlit** for a seamless web interface, ensuring ease of use for students. We implemented a profile matching system that allows users to filter and swipe to find the perfect housemates or sublets. The backend handles user data in a database linking their information to their login authentication, and the interface prioritizes accessibility and simplicity. Every design decision—whether it was selecting color palettes, crafting layouts, or defining profile and housing criteria—was driven by our commitment to making RoomieU both user-friendly and approachable.

## Challenges We Faced
We faced several challenges along the way:
- **UI/UX Design**: Balancing an appealing design with functional simplicity required multiple iterations and feedback.
- **Git Collaboration**: With one team member having no prior knowledge of Git and others with limited experience, it was initially challenging to get everyone aligned on version control workflows. However, we worked together to ensure everyone was comfortable using version control, enabling effective teamwork on shared code files.
- **Time Constraints**: Balancing development with other responsibilities as students was challenging, but it reinforced our ability to manage time effectively. 

Given more time, we would have focused on implementing additional features, such as touch screen swiping and an algorithm to prioritize profiles that are most likely to result in a match.

RoomieU represents our passion for solving real-world problems with technology and the collaborative effort of our entire team. We’re excited about the potential impact it can have on simplifying the housing search for students everywhere!
